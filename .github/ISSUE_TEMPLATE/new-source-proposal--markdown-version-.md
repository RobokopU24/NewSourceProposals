##  New Source Proposal

This form supports evaluation based on FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).  
You do not need to complete every field — enter what you know and link to additional information where possible.

---

###  Source Name  
**Full name and acronym, if applicable**  
`e.g., Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD)`

---

###  Description  
**Short summary of the source’s purpose and content**  
`e.g., CTD provides curated data on chemical–gene and chemical–disease interactions.`

---

###  Maintainer  
**Individual or organization responsible for the source**  
`e.g., NC State University`

---

###  Use-case Link (if applicable)  
**If this source supports a specific ROBOKOP use case, please link to the exact issue in the Use-Cases repo and briefly describe the connection.**  
`e.g., https://github.com/RobokopU24/Use-Cases/issues/1 — expands coverage for rare disease phenotype mapping`

---

###  Proposed Impact  
**What benefit would the inclusion of this source provide?**  
`e.g., This dataset would expand coverage of metabolite–gene interactions in cancer biology.`

---

###  Proponent  
**How was this source brought to our attention?**  
`e.g., “Translator Listserv discussion”, "John Smith", "Conference Presentation", "Manuscript"`

---

###  Access Mechanism  
**Link to website, download page, or API documentation**  
`e.g., https://...`

---

###  License  
**License name and any use restrictions (e.g., CC-BY 4.0, CC0)**  
`e.g., CC-BY 4.0`  
> ⚠️ **Note**: ROBOKOP currently does not ingest proprietary sources, require payment, or impose restrictive access terms.

###  Biological Levels Covered  
**Select all levels of biological content that apply:**  
- [ ] Small Molecule / Drug  
- [ ] Protein / Gene / Nucleic Acid  
- [ ] Organelle / Cell  
- [ ] Tissue / Organ  
- [ ] Mechanism of Action  
- [ ] Biological Process / Pathway  
- [ ] Disease / Phenotype  
- [ ] Environmental Exposure  
- [ ] Other (please specify below)

**If you selected "Other" above, please specify:**  
`e.g., Cell Line, Pathogen, etc.`

---

###  Additional Information  
**Please provide any additional information that you think is relevant to the DMOG review.**  
`e.g., This source has been cited in recent rare disease mechanism studies and supports tissue-specific annotations. It also offers a public API that could be used for automated updates.`
