# ROBOKOP New Source Proposal Tracker

Welcome to the ROBOKOP New Source Proposal Tracker. This repository is managed by the **Data Modeling Oversight Group (DMOG)** and is used to gather and evaluate candidate data sources for potential inclusion in the ROBOKOP knowledge graph.

## About

ROBOKOP (Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways) integrates diverse biomedical datasets into a knowledge graph that supports question answering, discovery, and hypothesis generation.

To maintain high quality and interoperability, all proposed sources are evaluated based on:
- Scientific relevance
- Technical compatibility (with Biolink and KGX)
- Licensing and accessibility
- Alignment with **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)

This repository tracks source proposals and enables community members, collaborators, and maintainers to suggest new datasets for inclusion.

**To learn more about ROBOKOP:**
- [robokop.renci.org](https://robokop.renci.org) — public interface for exploring the knowledge graph
- [RobokopU24 GitHub organization](https://github.com/RobokopU24) — codebase, documentation, and related projects
